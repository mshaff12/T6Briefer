T6Briefer.com was developed to help flight students prepare for briefs. It allows students to calculate aircraft performance data for the T-6 Texan II using current weather. Weather is displayed in METAR format and gathered using an API referencing aviationweather.gov. T6Briefer.com gives students quick access to all syllabus pages for the flight program and Critical Action Memory Items (Emergency Procedures). The home page also allows students to access their squadron's schedule.
